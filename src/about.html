                            Nifty is a family business based on a ranch at Veteran in east-central Alberta, Canada.
                            The ranch consists of 3600 acres of dryland, with a 200 commercial cow/calf operation.
                            In the rolling plains of east central Alberta, the ranch is less than an hour from the Saskatchewan border.

                            Calvin and Judy Bishell, owners of Nifty Livestock Equipment, focus their business on products that benefit livestock producers, ranging from a full line of cattle handling equipment to watering systems and feeding/fencing supplies.
                            Before adding any new product to their product line, it must first be &quot;ranch-proven&quot; in their operation.

                            Most of the products are a result of their search for better and easier livestock handling equipment for their ranch.
                            &quot;We don't sell anything that hasn't been used on our ranch, and we don't sell anything we don't believe in.&quot;
                            They also offer a referral service to their clients for products they are unable to supply.

                            Nifty Livestock Equipment Ltd. got its start in 1986 when Calvin invented the Nifty Feed Dispenser, ending his search for a suitable option for dispensing grain, pellets or supplements to livestock under range feeding conditions.
                            Several dry years forced the Bishell's to resort to feeding pellets and straw during much of the year.
                            After trying various labor and time consuming methods, such as hauling pails and sacks, and observing others using hoppers and open trucks, Calvin set to work devising a better method.

                            With a good supply of inventory on hand at all times, orders can be filled and delivered quickly.
