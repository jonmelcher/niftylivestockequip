      How to solve the problem of fencing through a slough or marshy area that
      is under water at least part of the year can be a real challenge. Building
      a fence that would hold and stay in place across an area with rising and
      falling water levels and even flowing water with ice chunks is difficult.<br>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&#149; constructed of a 5' X 4&quot; recycled
    plastic fence post</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&#149; float capable of lifting up to 85 lbs
    and a 65 lb concrete weight fixed to the bottom of the post</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&#149; aluminum pin above the float about 2'
    from the bottom keeps the float from sliding up the post and still leaves
    about 3' of post on which to fasten your wires</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&#149; w</font><font size="3" face="Arial">ires
    can be stapled to or a hole drilled through</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&#149;</font><font face="Arial" size="3">
      weight at the bottom of the post keeps it in an upright position and
      allows it to settle into the mud if the water level drops low enough</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&#149; moving water -&nbsp; a 3/16&quot; wire
    cable can be used rather than the high tensile wire</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&#149; a T brace on either side of the wet
    area helps keep the flexible floating fence in place and also alleviates the
    problem of stretching the adjoining fence. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&#149; p</font><font size="3" face="Arial">lastic
    posts work better than wood because they don't swell when wet and&nbsp; they
    hold the staples as well or better than wood</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&#149; </font><font face="Arial">b</font><font face="Arial">eavers
    are not attracted to the plastic posts and cattle don't like to rub on them</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&#149; the Wetland Fence Buoys can be strung
    across a wet area with a 50' - 150'&nbsp; spacing between posts</font></p>
